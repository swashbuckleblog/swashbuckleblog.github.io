<p>Every human being on earth, from the smallest newborn to Hulk Hogan, should be able to dunk a basketball.</p>

<p>Why do I believe this?  Great question!  First, it's because I can dunk a basketball.  If I can dunk, so can you!</p>

<p>Second, it's because I firmly belive in equal opportunity.  Which is why everyone should have the opportunity to dunk. And if they're not as tall as me, they should have the opportunity to grow.  And then dunk!</p>

<p>Did I mention that I can dunk a basketball?</p>

<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, dunking brings us closer to the sky, literally, which is where Santa Claus and Michael Jackson are.  Plus, I once read that if we all dunk at the same time, there will be a massive earthquake.</p>

<p>(But none of us will feel it, because we'll be in the air DUNKING)</p>

<p>Aren't Jun out!</p>
