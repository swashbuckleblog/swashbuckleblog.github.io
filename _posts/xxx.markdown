<p>Hi again!</p>

<p>It's me, Joe, from Swashbuckle.  We exchanged a few emails a couple months ago.  And then I exchanged some, by myself.  Well, I sent them to you, but you never wrote back.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, then the weeks became fortnights (I just learned that word, isn't it cool, it makes me sound British, doesn't it!?), then the fortnights (awesome word!) became months. No reply.</p>

<p>I occasionally would open some of the emails I had sent you, to see if perhaps I had said something offensive, but nope, they were pretty vanilla.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Seriously, why won't you just give me your data?</h2>

<p>You sounded so excited on the phone. You were like "yeah, let's do this, cool!" and I was like "alright, yeah, great!"  Such positive energy, man!  I was so pumped after our call that I kicked a baby!</p>

<p>(Don't worry, it wasn't some stranger's baby.  This was a baby that's been hanging around my house for a while, acting weird and stuff.)

<p>Anyway, so, what happened?  I mean, did you meet someone else to whom you're gonna give your data?  Am I being overbearing?  Underbearing?  Do you want me to better balance my bearing?</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The line is going up.  Or down.  It depends which side you start on.</span>

See how the line is trending towards the axis at which the radial galapogos goose goes going?  What I mean to say is that the Ugandan, er, money is being increasingly increased while the American, uh, deflation!

Which brings me to my next point.  Human travel to Mars is not as inevitable as some would make you think.

<h2 class="section-heading">Mars?  Forget about it!</h2>

<p>All this talk about Mars.  Mars this, mars that.  Why the obsession with this inhospitable wasteland.  Proximity?  If we wanted close, we'd move to New Jersey, not Mars!</p>

<p>Plus, Jupiter isn't really that far away.  See?</p>

<p>I say we go to Jupiter, first.  Jupiter has many advantageous advantages.  It has three nice-sounding syllables, beautiful rings, and it is the only planet after which NONE of the seven dwarves are named! </p>

<p>Gotta go! </p>
