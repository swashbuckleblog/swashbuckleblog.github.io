Investing is about using information available now to predict the future. It’s hard, always has been, and always will be. But we are entering into an era of data, and the availability of novel sources of information will radically transform investing… for those who know how to use that information.

# **ERA OF DATA SCARCITY**

In the era of data scarcity (ie, beginning of time until about 1995), financial institutions operated in the dark, treating different customers, product classes and geographies identically, or relying on informal and inconsistent anecdotal systems (charitably called “rules of thumb”) to inform their lending decisions. Data scarcity led to uncertainty, inefficiency and loss, which translated into high interest rates, particularly for those in low-income countries.

# **ERA OF DATA ABUNDANCE**

From temperature, precipitation and vegetation density to acts of violence, agricultural prices and exchange rates, never before have so many real-time, relevant, and quality data been available for emerging markets. However, many non-deposit taking credit institutions still operate under the (false) premise of data scarcity. By not fully taking advantage of the era of data, they incorrectly exclude potentially good customers, and keep from market potentially profitable products. Just as importantly, investors accustomed to making decisions based on hard data avoid these institutions. Frontier financial institutions, lacking access to large-scale commercial capital, resign themselves to non-scalable operational structures (region-specific banks) and charity (Kiva). An over-reliance on small and charitable models for finance cripples economies, and has created the current situation in which only residents of rich countries have access to financial products (below):

# **FRONTIER LENDING NEEDS BIG DATA**

A profitable, scalable business model of lending to the unbanked does not simply use big data - it needs it. Though we are living in the era of data, standardized consumer credit scoring has not yet emerged in areas where microfinance is most established [link to Jim’s post about credit scoring]. Accordingly, financial institutions operating in the developing world must rely on alternative sources.
Without a wealth of atypical data streams, loan originators and their investors are operating blindly. But they don’t have to. Whether it’s collecting their own data directly, gathering data through integrations with existing technology, or simply matching external and internal datasets, there is simply too much out there to ignore. But identifying “signal” (and distinguishing it from “noise”) is the difference between successful and failed data-driven finance. 

# **LENDABLE'S ROLE IN THE ERA OF DATA**

To help originators and investors correctly quantify risk and identify opportunity, Lendable taps into originators’ data in a way that they cannot afford to, using specialized tools and techniques. It’s building a platform to link to a wide array of data sources, some obvious, and some obscure. It provides credit scoring and revenue forecasting for originators, and risk quantification and portfolio diligence for investors. Unlike many consultants and ad-hoc analysis firms, Lendable builds extensible tools and algorithms, making our analyses scalable, rapid and as void of subjectivity as possible.


When Lendable partners with an originator or investor, it taps into two kinds of information: (1) the loan originators’ raw data and (2) external data sources. In the past, Lendable has modeled loan repayment outcomes based on proximity to urban centers, precipitation, and income type. But what works for one originator, might not work for another. Knowing what predicts best is a challenging task, for which Lendable employs its proprietary Risk Engine to automatically determine which data sources are helpful in assessing the risk of a given originator’s portfolio. 


For the Risk Engine’s machine learning algorithms to do their job, we are constantly on the hunt for data. We scrape and munge, clean and crunch. “Big” data isn’t good enough - it’s also got to be machine readable, standardized, bias-free, real-time, granular and trustworthy.

Though not easy, constant exploration of outside data is worth the effort.  By exploring a wide array of sources and integrating them with loan repayment information, we can predict what future cash flows will look like, as well as identify pockets of correlated risk. For example the below chart shows the Risk Engine's actual performance on predicting cash flows from real portfolios.

Understanding the forces that drive repayments and defaults enables originators to improve their operations and helps investors to build a portfolio with an appropriate and realistically quantified amount of risk. Most importantly, understanding cash flows facilitates the match-making between on-the-ground frontier finance originators and commercial capital. In other words, data is the engine that Lendable will use to drive frontier finance to massive scale.
