<p>I love economics so much.  I mean really, is there any other "academic discipline" that combines astrology, heresay, hunches and witchraft, and yet still gets a Nobel every year?  Economics is the farking beez-kneez, bitch.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point: currency.  "Currency" from the latin "current" meaning that moment in the conversation when everyone realizes someone farted, but nobody wants to talk bout it. Not really going anywhere with that.  I just find that starting all discussions of any topic with a quick "from the latin..." makes me look smart.  And chicks dig it.</p>

<p>So, what's so significant about currency?  Or better, what's so current about significancy?!?!  Aha - you didn't see that coming, did you?</p>

<p>An old wise man once told a shopkeeper, "if you keep your savings in gold, then the government will tax you; if you keep your savings in rice, then you will be tempted to eat it. But, if you keep your savings in this <a href="http://www.tierrayucatan.com/listings/en/4">once-in-a-lifetime real estate investment opportunity</a>, then you will be rich and all the girls will love you.  </p>

<p>I'm "legally obligated" to tell you that Swashbuckle has a professional agreement with the above real estate agency.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Currency is the only thing that matters</h2>

<p>Really, it is.  Screw Christmas, forget your marital vows, and park in the handicapped spot, cause if it ain't currency, I ain't listening!</p>

<p>For real!  If you don't believe me, look at the below chart.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">The line is going up.  Or down.  It depends which side you start on.</span>

See how the line is trending towards the axis at which the radial galapogos goose goes going?  What I mean to say is that the Ugandan, er, money is being increasingly increased while the American, uh, deflation!

Which brings me to my next point.  Human travel to Mars is not as inevitable as some would make you think.

<h2 class="section-heading">Mars?  Forget about it!</h2>

<span class="caption text-muted">Coffee is the motor that keeps the economy running.  All swashbucklers know that.</span>

<p>All this talk about Mars.  Mars this, mars that.  Why the obsession with this inhospitable wasteland.  Proximity?  If we wanted close, we'd move to New Jersey, not Mars!</p>

<p>Plus, Jupiter isn't really that far away.  See?</p>

<a href="#">

<span class="caption text-muted">Earth and Jupiter.  Not to scale..</span>


<p>I say we go to Jupiter, first.  Jupiter has many advantageous advantages.  It has three nice-sounding syllables, beautiful rings, and it is the only planet after which NONE of the seven dwarves are named! </p>

<p>Gotta go! </p>
